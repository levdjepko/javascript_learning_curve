    In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next 
    hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards 
    remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.
Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player.
Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. 
When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When 
the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.
